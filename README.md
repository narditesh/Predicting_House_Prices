# Predicting_House_Prices
This project builds and evaluates machine learning models (Linear Regression, Ridge, and LASSO) to predict house prices using various property features.
# Overview

This project builds and evaluates machine learning models Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and LASSO Regression to predict house prices based on different property features.
The goal is to understand feature relationships, improve model performance, and compare regularized models.

# Dataset

The dataset contains numerical features related to houses (e.g., Lot Size, bedrooms, house Age, etc.) and the target variable House_Price.

# Key steps performed:

Data inspection using df.info(), df.describe(), and shape analysis

Correlation analysis

Heatmap visualization

Train–test split

Model training and evaluation

Regularization (Ridge & LASSO)

Saving the best model using joblib
